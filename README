NAME
       pushkey - Pushes ssh key to remote server and generates ssh key if non-existent.

SYNOPSIS
       pushkey [user@machine] [-i [identity_file]] [-p [port number]]

DESCRIPTION
       Pushes  your  ssh  key  to a remote location. If the remote machine has never been setup with keys before, then pushkey will create a .ssh folder and add your ssh key to authorized_keys file. It will
       also apply the 700 permission on the folder and 600 on the file.

OPTIONS
       If you want to specify a different identiy_file (optional) then you must run pushkey with the -i switch. If you dont specify a identiy_file (-i switch) then pushkey will attempt to use id_dsa.pub. If
       it doesnt find that file it will try id_rsa.pub next. If both options exhausted then it will go through the process of creating one for you.
       Specifying the port (-p) number is also optional. If you dont specify one then it will use default ssh port 22.

EXAMPLES
            pushkey 192.168.0.1
            pushkey al@myfqdn.com
            pushkey fqdn.com -i /path/id_key.pub
            pushkey 192.168.0.1 -i /path/file -p 80
            pushkey myfqdn -p 80
